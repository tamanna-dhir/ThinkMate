ThinkMate ♟️

Your mind's best mate on the board

An intelligent chess platform that transforms how players learn and improve, combining AI-powered gameplay with personalized coaching and strategic insights.

 Overview
ThinkMate is more than just a chess engine—it's an intelligent mentor designed to help players grow their skills through personalized, AI-driven guidance. Built with a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), ThinkMate serves as both a challenging opponent and an insightful coach, analyzing your gameplay and providing strategic recommendations tailored to your skill level.
The Problem We Solve
While chess is immensely popular worldwide, most players face a significant learning gap after mastering the basics. Traditional platforms often:

Function as impersonal opponents without constructive feedback
Provide overwhelming analysis that's difficult to understand
Lack personalized guidance for beginners and intermediate players
Fail to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical gameplay

ThinkMate addresses these challenges by offering an affordable, interactive learning platform that grows with you—making systematic improvement accessible without requiring personal coaching or the ability to decipher complex engine analysis.

Data Flow: The Play-by-Play

Move Made → Player makes a move on the interactive frontend board
Request Sent → Frontend sends the board position to Flask backend's /move API
AI Thinks → Backend preprocesses data and invokes the ChessNet CNN model
Move Calculated → AI analyzes the position and predicts the best strategic response
Result Returned → Backend sends AI's move back as a clean JSON response
Board Updates → Frontend receives the move and instantly updates the chessboard
